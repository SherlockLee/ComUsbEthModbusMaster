; This file lists all of the files that you want to place on 
; a user's machine. It should contain all of your classes organized
; in the correct directory hierarchy, specified by your package 
; names.

; Leave this.

.OPTION EXPLICIT 

;*********************************
; Insert the name for your cab file here. You will need to
; use this name in both master.ddf and your inf, so remember your
; choice.
;
.Set CabinetNameTemplate=freemodbus.cab
;*********************************

; Leave these settings.

.Set DiskDirectoryTemplate=
.Set Cabinet=on
.Set Compress=on
.Set MaxCabinetSize=0
.Set MaxDiskSize=CDROM

; ***********************
; This is the main section. You will list the names of all
; of your classes here, with their full virtual pathnames.
; You also need to specify each destination directory before you
; list the files in that directory. We highly recommend that you
; make all of your packages start with a name that should be unique
; to you, so that you have your own subdirectory on the user's machine
; and don't have to worry about having your files written over.
;
; For example, say that your classes are
; Vendor.Applet.class
; Vendor.Content.ContentContainer.class
; Vendor.Content.ContentHelper.class
; Vendor.Util.Loader.class
;
; Then this file should read (don't forget to change this!)

.Set DestinationDir=FreeModbus\Util
FreeModbus\Util\Modbus.class
FreeModbus\Util\ModbusException.class

.Set DestinationDir=FreeModbus\AppletTest
FreeModbus\AppletTest\DialogLayout.class
FreeModbus\AppletTest\ModbusMonitorDlg.class
FreeModbus\AppletTest\ModbusMonitor.class

; Alternatively, if you decide to use a .ZIP file (as explained in the
; README), you just need to list one file here, without subdirectories.
; Something like

;vendor.zip

; will be fine. Be sure to make your name unique, so that other vendors
; won't overwrite it.

; That's all--you're finished!
